* Gameplay Ideas
** Sorting words as a gameplay mechanic?
*** Potential Keybindings
**** ~SPC v~ for vowels
**** ~SPC s <letter>~ for words that begin with a given letter
**** ~SPC e <letter>~ for words that end with a given letter
*** Cooldown between switching letters
*** It could get to the point where switching between sorting modes is just as important as typing words itself
* PriorityQueue
** Words sorted by x position?
** Every collection of words can return...?
* Progression of Powerups
** In order
*** Words are typed one at a time
*** Player has no control over order
*** After one word is done, the player goes to the next word
** Sorted
*** Player controls how the order of the words
*** The player picks the order, but then has to type the words in that order until switching to some different order
** Order doesn't matter
*** currentWord is selected when the player types the first letter of a word
*** the next word is selected in the same way
** Letter order doesn't matter
*** the player picks the next word just like before
*** the order that the letters are typed doesn't matter
*** typing giuaennas is valid for completing the word sanguine
** Multiple words at once
*** Every letter typed affects every word in the array
*** If the words are soccer, sausage, sanguine, Scottish, and sentimental, typing "s" would remove the first s in all of these
** Multiple words at once, order doesn't matter
*** The order the letters are typed doesn't matter 
*** the characters that are typed are cleared for all words in the current array
